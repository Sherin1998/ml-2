    "Generalization refers to your model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model. If you train a model too well on training data, it will be incapable of generalizing. In such cases, it will end up making erroneous predictions when it’s given new data. This would make the model ineffective even though it’s capable of making correct predictions for the training data set. This is known as overfitting. The inverse (underfitting) is also true, which happens when you train a model with inadequate data. In cases of underfitting, your model would fail to make accurate predictions even with the training data"
